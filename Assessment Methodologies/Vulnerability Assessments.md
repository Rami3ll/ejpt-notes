a zero day is a "recently discovered" vulner, that was "previously unknown"/"previously unidentified" to developers or anyone capable of mitigating it, insinuating they have zero days to fix such a vulner.
- a zero day could arise when the developers were just made aware but have not been able to release a fix OR are not aware at all of the existence of the bug - Both leading to "zero day attacks" meaning the use of a zero day exploit on a zero day vuler.
- When they are made aware it becomes just a vulner.
